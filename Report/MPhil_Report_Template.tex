\begin{abstract}
This is my abstract. This document is a demonstration of the power of
\LaTeX{} as originally developed by Leslie Lamport. We describe the
various features of \LaTeX{}, demonstrate the inclusion of elements such
as pictures, formul\ae, and references.
We conclude that LaTeX is a suitable system for producing professional
papers for publication in high-impact journals.

\section{\LaTeX{} features}
\LaTeX{} was originally developed by Leslie Lamport \cite{LaTeXBook} as a set of
macros on top of the \TeX{} language developed by Donald Knuth \cite{TeXBook}. It has a
number of features which make it well suited to professional
scientific publishing, including the ability to typeset mathematical
formul\ae, justify text well, and include pictures at various
points.\par
In section \ref{sect:Formulae} we show some mathematical formul\ae
that can be used within \LaTeX{}. In section \ref{sect:Pictures} we
demonstrate the inclusion of figures, including captions. Finally, in
\ref{sect:Concl}, we conclude that \LaTeX{} is an excellent typesetting
mechanism for scientific publications.

\section{Mathematical formulae}
\label{sect:Formulae}
Complex formulae are easy to produce within \LaTeX{}. For example, we
can use inline equations to define $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x +
a_0$, and then provide more complex equations such as
\begin{equation}
\int_0^3 f(x) \mathrm{d}x = \left[\frac{a_3}{4}x^4 + \frac{a_2}{3}x^3
  + \frac{a_1}{2}x^2 + a_0x\right]_0^3
\label{eqn:Taylor}
\end{equation}
If we have some derivation that should belong elsewhere, we can put it
in an appendix such as \ref{app:quad}. We can also refer to equations
from the main text such as the Taylor expansion (\ref{eqn:Taylor}).
\section{Pictures}
\label{sect:Pictures}
In this section we demonstrate the inclusion of figures. For example,
Figure~\ref{fig:ENO1} demonstrates ENO as used to solve a linear advection
of a top-hat function.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{ENOTest3b.png}
\caption{Demonstration of ENO as used to solver linear-advection of a
  top-hat function.}
\label{fig:ENO1}
\end{figure}
\section{Conclusions}
\label{sect:Concl}
In which we conclude that LaTeX (or \LaTeX) is very useful for
generating scientific papers as demonstrated above.

\section{On the Derivation of the Quadratic Formula}
\label{app:quad}
The derivation of the quadratic formula is something that would not
fit well within a paper as it would interrupt the flow of the argument
therein. However, for those students who need a refresher on how the
quadratic formula is derived, we give full details here:\par
Assume that we have
\begin{equation}
p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
\end{equation}
and so on. The actual algebra is left as an exercise for the reader.
